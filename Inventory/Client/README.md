# SQLAdmin Client

Implememtation of various **SQLAdmin** clients.

## Operational GUI

To make the **SQLAdmin** client fast and capable enough is should be considered to build it on Microsoft DirectX. 
This should be done using C++ to gain access to the full functionality of DirectX.

_WPF_ could also be considered, as it can give a fast enough GUI. Also it can be deployed with _ClickOnce_ which makes deployment effective.

## Reporting

The **SQLAdmin** reporting components should be web based and maybe placed in public cloud like Microsoft Azure.

The implementation of **SQLAdmin** reporting could be build on Microsoft ASP.NET with C#.
