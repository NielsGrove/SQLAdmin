# SQLAdmin
Tools for SQL Server Administration.
See details and the ideas behind in the wiki.

SQLAdmin tool consists of two major components:

* _[SQLAdmin Server](./Server/README.md)_ 
* _[SQLAdmin Client](./Client/README.md)_

Other folders like [Scripts](./Scripts/) are for secondary SQL Server database administration outside the SQLAdmin tool.
